# The Breath of Nature: A Gratitude Journal for the Air of National Parks

Hello dear readers,

This week, we celebrate an event which is near and dear to my heart: **National Park Week** from April 20-28. A time to be thankful for the conservation and enjoyment of nature provided by national parks. Let's take a moment to express our gratitude for these majestic spaces that inspire, rejuvenate, and invite us to connect with the wild.

### Day 1 - Prelude to Adventure

I remember stepping into the park, the clean air hitting my lungs, and the rush of awe captivating my senses. It was like being in the embrace of a giant, humbling and inspiring. The vibrant ecosystem, with its own rhythm and harmony, played the most relaxing symphony, calming the inner turmoil that the city had stirred within me. I am grateful for this moment of sheer tranquility.

### Day 2 - Breathing in the Culture

A guided tour gave me an insight into the native history of the place. I felt a surge of gratitude for those who've fought to protect this sanctuary, leaving behind a legacy that informs and inspires millions every year.

### Day 3 - Soaring with the Eagles

Watching a majestic eagle soar overhead, I felt an inexplicable connection - a fellow creature under the same sun, sharing the same air. It was a poignant moment of interspecies kinship. Here's to our feathered friends.

### Day 4 - Meditative Mornings

The morning dew on the leaves, the chirping of birds, the rustle of a gentle breeze - these were my alarm clocks that week. Getting up at dawn, taking in lungfuls of pure, rejuvenating air – there’s no better feeling of starting the day right.

### Day 5 - The Great Outdoors

Rappelling down a cliff, every gasp of fear was immediately followed by a gasp of awe at the beauty that unfolded beneath me. The air was crisp, the view, breathtaking. The smell of the earth and trees, the taste of freedom – an unforgettable sensory cocktail.

### Day 6 - Life in the Water

Dipping my toes in a crystal-clear stream, I could feel the freshness of the water. As I watched the fish dance in the current, I was reminded that every form of life, no matter how small, has a meaningful role in this majestic ecosystem. I am endlessly thankful for this delicate balance of nature.

### Day 7 - Reflections Under the Stars

Ending the week under a blanket of stars, the chilly night air was a stark contrast to the warmth of the campfire. The silence of the night, punctuated by distant howls, felt like a symphony of gratitude to the universe. There, in that silence, I felt connected to the universe and infinitely grateful for this amazing week of freely breathing, exploring, and living in the moment.

*Keep exploring, keep breathing, and keep living!*

 Yours,
