# Health for All: The Universal Goal of World Health Day

## Health, a treasure to behold, 
On this day, we raise our voices bold. 
Shared with the world a boundless truth, 
Health for All, a noble proof.

Today, the 7th of April and time's review, 
We honor a day that truly asks, 
Do we do our part to mend the tear, 
In the tapestry called global care, 
To mend must be our shout and prayer. 

## An ordinary day, yet a day of grace, 
Where we turn our focus on each weary face, 
Faces far off, across the sea, 
In the silent call for richer health we plea.

We share stories, crafted with care, 
Of hope and love found somewhere, 
Take the tale of Lucy, whose faith did not tire, 
She helped build clinics, a hope-filled fire.

Or Jacob from the distant plains, 
Who tirelessly led the charge, 
To educate and break life's chains, 
With the gift of health care's warm embrace.

## We seek progress in every sunray, 
In research and the healthful way, 
The breakthroughs in modern lore, 
That brings healing to the distant shore.

And so on this day, let us hold, 
The promise of health to unfold, 
For each heart that beats, each soul that knows, 
A world with health â€“ a universal rose.

Health for All, a goal so grand, 
United in this, we stand.
On World Health Day, this is our plea, 
A healthier world for you, for me.
