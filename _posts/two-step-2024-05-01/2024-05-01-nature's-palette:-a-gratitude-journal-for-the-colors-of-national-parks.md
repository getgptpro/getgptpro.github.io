# Nature's Palette: A Gratitude Journal for the Colors of National Parks

April 20-28, in the spirit of National Park Week, I find myself reflecting on the conservation and enjoyment of nature provided by our national parks. It's an opportunity to express my gratitude, not just for the physical presence of these majestic spaces, but for the emotional and spiritual nourishment they offer. They are a testament to the beauty and resilience of our planet, each park with its own story to tell.

## The Greens of the Forest
In the dense canopy of Park 'X', green is the prevailing color. Trees in varying shades of this life-affirming hue create a symphony of nature. I am thankful for the peace these forests bring, their towering canopies like cathedrals to the natural world. It reminds me of a time when I lost myself among the towering Redwoods, a sensation as close to transcendence as I have known.

## The Blues of the Lakes
Park 'Y' is home to a lake that offers an intense shade of blue that I can't find words to describe. It's as if the sky has fallen into the water, offering a reflection of the heavens. I am moved by the tranquility of the lake, a mirror to the wild beauty of the skies above. The memory of a peaceful boat ride on these waters still brings me comfort on stormy days.

## The Reds of the Desert
The stark, arid beauty of Park 'Z' amazes me each time. Reds and oranges that stretch to the horizon, a painting by nature herself. The first time I visited, I was struck by the desolation but also by the unexpected life that flourishes in such harsh conditions. The sunset here is a spectacle of red, a daily reminder that even in the most unlikely places, beauty flourishes.

## The Grays of the Mountains
The rugged mountains of Park 'A' stand tall, their gray slopes reaching towards the sky. I am thankful for their enduring presence, a reassuring fixture in a world that can feel transient and fleeting. Their majesty provides perspective and a sense of scale, grounding us within the vastness of nature. The first time I stood at the foot of these giants, I felt an array of emotions, but most of all, gratitude for such a powerful reminder of nature's scale and our place within it.

It's with a heart full of gratitude this National Park Week, that I celebrate the 'Nature's Palette' in all its glory, diversity, and splendor. These parks are more than just recreation; they are a source of inspiration, reflection, and rejuvenation that every individual should experience.
