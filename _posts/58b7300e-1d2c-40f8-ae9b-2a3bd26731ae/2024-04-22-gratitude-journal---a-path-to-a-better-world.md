## About Gratitude Journal

Gratitude Journal is a daily journal that harnesses the power of gratitude to create a better world. By focusing on the blessings in our lives, we can shift our mindset and take action to make a positive impact on global challenges such as climate change, food insecurity, gender inequality, poverty, and societal injustice.

## How Gratitude Journal Works

Our journal is designed to help you cultivate an attitude of gratitude in just 5 minutes a day. By reflecting on three things you are grateful for, you can train your mind to recognize the silver lining in any situation. This simple practice has been proven to increase happiness and well-being.

## Join the Thankful Movement

At Thankful, we believe that being thankful is more than just a feeling; it is a powerful force for good. By using our Gratitude Journal, you are not only improving your own life but also contributing to a global movement of positive change.
