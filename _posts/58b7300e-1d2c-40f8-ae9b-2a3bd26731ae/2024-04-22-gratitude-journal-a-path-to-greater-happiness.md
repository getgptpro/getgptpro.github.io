The holiday season often brings with it high expectations for a cozy and festive time of year. However, for many, this time of year is tinged with sadness, anxiety, or depression. While major depression or severe anxiety disorders benefit most from professional help, what about those who just feel lost, overwhelmed, or down at this time of year? Research (and common sense) suggests that one aspect of the Thanksgiving season can actually lift the spirits, and it's built right into the holiday — being grateful.

The word gratitude is derived from the Latin word gratia, which means grace, graciousness, or gratefulness (depending on the context). In some ways, gratitude encompasses all of these meanings. Gratitude is a thankful appreciation for what an individual receives, whether tangible or intangible. With gratitude, people acknowledge the goodness in their lives. In the process, people usually recognize that the source of that goodness lies at least partially outside themselves. As a result, being grateful also helps people connect to something larger than themselves as individuals — whether to other people, nature, or a higher power.

In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships. People feel and express gratitude in multiple ways. They can apply it to the past (retrieving positive memories and being thankful for elements of childhood or past blessings), the present (not taking good fortune for granted as it comes), and the future (maintaining a hopeful and optimistic attitude).

Gratitude is a way for people to appreciate what they have, instead of always reaching for something new in the hope it will make them happier, or thinking they can't feel satisfied until every physical and material need is met. Gratitude helps people refocus on what they have instead of what they lack. And, although it may feel contrived at first, this mental state grows stronger with use and practice.

Here are some ways to cultivate gratitude on a regular basis:

1. **Write a thank-you note**: You can make yourself happier and nurture your relationship with another person by writing a thank-you letter or email expressing your enjoyment and appreciation of that person's impact on your life. Send it, or better yet, deliver and read it in person if possible.

2. **Make a habit of sending at least one gratitude letter a month**: Once in a while, write one to yourself.

3. **Thank someone mentally**: No time to write? It may help just to think about someone who has done something nice for you, and mentally thank the individual.

4. **Keep a gratitude journal**: Make it a habit to write down or share with a loved one thoughts about the gifts you've received each day.

5. **Count your blessings**: Pick a time every week to sit down and write about your blessings — reflecting on what went right or what you are grateful for.

6. **Pray**: People who are religious can use prayer to cultivate gratitude.

7. **Meditate**: Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. Although people often focus on a word or phrase (such as "peace"), it is also possible to focus on what you're grateful for (the warmth of the sun, a pleasant sound, etc.).

By incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you can cultivate a greater sense of gratitude, which in turn can lead to increased happiness and well-being.
