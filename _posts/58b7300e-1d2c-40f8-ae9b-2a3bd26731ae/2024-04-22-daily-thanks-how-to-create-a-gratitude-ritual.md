# Daily Thanks: How to Create a Gratitude Ritual

As November rolls around, we're lighting our first fires of the season, finding our coziest sweaters, and thinking about what we're thankful for. But we shouldn't just take stock of the things to be grateful for in our lives once a year.

There are many powerful benefits to making gratitude a part of your daily life year-round, even after you've successfully roasted the turkey and eaten too much pie. Practicing gratitude can not only help to boost your mood, help train your brain to see the positive more often, reducing daily stress, anxiety, and frustration. A regular gratitude practice can help to increase your empathy levels, help you feel more empowered and confident, and teach you to recognize the things you already have.

Did you know that gratitude is also great for your physical health? It can help reduce stress and decrease everyday aches and pains and help to improve your sleep.
Overall, a regular gratitude practice makes you more resilient. Read on for 7 easy steps for building your own daily gratitude ritual.

## Gratitude Prompts to Get You Started

1. **Have a Gratitude Notebook**
   - Choose a notebook you find beautiful where you can track your gratitude practice. Having something inspiring makes you all that more likely to stick to your ritual. Keeping your gratitude journal all in one place allows you to look back through your entries when you might be feeling a little down and need a reminder of what brings you joy.

2. **Create a Routine Surrounding Your Gratitude**
   - Routines are a great way to ensure that you actually stick to your gratitude practice, making it an important part of your every day. Whether you choose to do it before you fall asleep each night or over a cup of morning tea, try to make it a part of something you’re already doing each day.

3. **Take a Moment to Center Yourself**
   - Before you try to dive into your gratitude practice, take a moment to center and calm yourself. Clear your mind and take a couple of deep breaths.

4. **Get Specific**
   - Gratitude doesn’t have to be huge, and one of the ways to enhance your gratitude practice is by focusing on all the little details and learning to appreciate them.

5. **Focus on Feelings**
   - Gratitude is about more than the actual thing or person that you’re grateful for: it’s about how it makes you feel.

6. **Write about People, Things, and Experiences**
   - Once you’re in a routine of practicing gratitude, it can be easy to fall into a trend of focusing on only one type of thing that you are grateful for. Don’t be afraid to diversify by focusing on physical items, people, and experiences.

7. **Show Your Gratitude**
   - Write a letter to a loved one (whether you mail it or not), write a love letter to yourself, or give back through volunteering to demonstrate your appreciation.
