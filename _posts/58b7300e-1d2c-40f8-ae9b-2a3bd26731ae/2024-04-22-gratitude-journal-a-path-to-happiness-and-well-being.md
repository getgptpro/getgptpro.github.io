## What is Gratitude?
Gratitude is the expression of appreciation for what one has. It is a recognition of value independent of monetary worth. Spontaneously generated from within, it is an affirmation of goodness and warmth. This social emotion strengthens relationships, and its roots run deep in evolutionary history—emanating from the survival value of helping others and being helped in return.

## Why Gratitude Matters
Psychologists find that, over time, feeling grateful boosts happiness and fosters both physical and psychological health, even among those already struggling with mental health problems. Studies show that practicing gratitude curbs the use of words expressing negative emotions and shifts inner attention away from such negative emotions as resentment and envy, minimizing the possibility of ruminating, which is a hallmark of depression.

## How to Cultivate Gratitude
Gratitude starts with noticing the goodness in life. A materialistic culture that encourages constant wanting and sees possessions as the source of happiness is not the most fertile ground for gratitude. But it is not an insurmountable barrier to developing it. Envy and especially cynicism and narcissism are similarly thieves of gratitude. In fact, the cultivation of gratitude may be at least a partial remedy for narcissism.

## Tips to Foster Gratitude
1. **Keep a journal** of or in some way note big and little joys of daily life.
2. **Write down "three good things"**—identify three things that have gone well for you and identify the cause.
3. **Write thank-you notes to others**.
4. **Think about people who have inspired you** and what about them was most significant.
5. **Engage in "mental subtraction"**. Imagine what your life would be like if some positive event had not occurred.

By incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you can cultivate a sense of gratitude that will enhance your overall well-being and happiness. The Gratitude Journal is here to help you on this journey, providing a space for reflection and growth as you focus on the blessings in your life.
