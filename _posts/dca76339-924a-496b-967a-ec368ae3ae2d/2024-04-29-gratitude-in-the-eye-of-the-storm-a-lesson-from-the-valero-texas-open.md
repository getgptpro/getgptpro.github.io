Title: **Gratitude in the Eye of the Storm: A Lesson from the Valero Texas Open**

Subtitle: **Finding Silver Linings in the World of Golf**

The world of sports is a microcosm of life, with its ups and downs, victories and defeats, and moments of triumph and despair. The recent Valero Texas Open, a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, has given us a perfect example of how gratitude can be a powerful tool, even in the most challenging circumstances.

**Akshay Bhatia's Journey: An Inspiration**

Akshay Bhatia, the young golfer who prevailed in the playoff at the 2024 Valero Texas Open, despite injuring his shoulder, is a testament to the power of gratitude. His victory was not just a win for him but a beacon of hope and inspiration for many. In the face of physical pain and the pressure of competition, Bhatia chose to focus on his blessings - his health, his talent, and the opportunity to compete.

**The Power of Gratitude: A Daily Practice**

Just like Bhatia, we too can cultivate gratitude in our lives, no matter the storm we are facing. A gratitude journal, like the one we offer, can be a powerful tool in this journey. By taking a few minutes each day to write down what we are grateful for, we can shift our focus from our troubles to our blessings.

**Counting Blessings, Not Troubles**

The final round of the Valero Texas Open was not just about the clubs Akshay Bhatia used to win (as detailed in the Winner's Bag), but also about the mental strength and gratitude he displayed. Similarly, our lives are not just about our material possessions or achievements, but also about our attitudes and perspectives.

**Gratitude in Action: Lessons from the Top-10 Finishers**

Peter Kuest, a BYU product who posted a top-10 finish at the Valero Texas Open, is another example of gratitude in action. As a Monday qualifier, he had every reason to feel overwhelmed or outmatched. Yet, he chose to focus on the opportunity to compete and the joy of the game, leading him to a remarkable finish.

**Conclusion: Gratitude as a Lifeline**

The Valero Texas Open has shown us that gratitude is not just a feel-good concept, but a powerful tool that can help us navigate life's storms. Whether we are facing physical challenges like Akshay Bhatia or stepping into arenas that seem intimidating like Peter Kuest, a gratitude journal can help us focus on our blessings, find our daily silver linings, and navigate our way to happiness.

In the words of the great golfer, Ben Hogan, "The only thing a golfer needs to plan is to improve." With a gratitude journal, we can plan not just to improve our game but also our outlook on life.
