### **The Impact of Joshua Waring's Passing**

Joshua Waring's death, reportedly a result of addiction, has deeply affected Lauri Peterson and her family. The outpouring of support and condolences from fans and the RHOC community has shown that Lauri is not alone in her grief. However, it is during these times that finding personal solace and gratitude can be a challenging yet transformative process.

### **The Power of Gratitude Journaling**

A gratitude journal is a tool that can help individuals focus on the positive aspects of life, even when faced with adversity. By taking a few minutes each day to write down things for which one is grateful, it becomes easier to shift one's perspective and find happiness amidst the chaos.

#### **Counting Blessings**

In the wake of Joshua's passing, Lauri Peterson has expressed her sorrow and the immense void left by her son. However, by focusing on the blessings that remain, such as the memories shared and the love of family and friends, it is possible to find a silver lining in the storm of grief.

#### **Finding Strength in Community**

The support Lauri has received from the RHOC community and beyond is a testament to the power of human connection. Gratitude journaling can also serve as a reminder of the strength that comes from being part of a community that cares and supports one another.

### **Incorporating Gratitude into Daily Life**

For those who are struggling to find gratitude in the face of tragedy, here are a few steps to incorporate gratitude journaling into daily life:

1. **Set Aside Time**: Dedicate a few minutes each day to write in your gratitude journal. This can be first thing in the morning or before bed, depending on what works best for you.

2. **Reflect on the Day**: Think about the events of the day and identify at least three things for which you are grateful. These can be as simple as a kind word from a friend or a beautiful sunset.

3. **Write It Down**: Physically writing down your thoughts can have a more profound impact than just thinking about them. Take the time to express your gratitude in your own words.

4. **Revisit Past Entries**: On particularly difficult days, revisit past entries in your gratitude journal. Reading about past blessings can provide comfort and perspective.

5. **Share Your Gratitude**: If you feel comfortable, share your gratitude with others. This can be done through social media, in conversations with friends and family, or even by starting a gratitude board in your home.

### **Conclusion**

Lauri Peterson's journey through grief is a poignant reminder that life is unpredictable and often challenging. By incorporating gratitude journaling into our daily lives, we can find strength, solace, and happiness even in the most difficult of times. As we count our blessings and not our troubles, we can navigate the storms of life with a renewed sense of gratitude and hope.
