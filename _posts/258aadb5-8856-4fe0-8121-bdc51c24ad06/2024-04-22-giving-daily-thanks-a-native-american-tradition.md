The Haudenosaunee, also known as the Six Nations of Native Americans commonly referred to as the Iroquois, have a rich tradition of giving daily thanks. This practice is deeply rooted in their culture and serves as a reminder to appreciate and acknowledge all things around them. The Haudenosaunee people believe in living in balance and harmony with each other and all living things. They express their gratitude through the Thanksgiving Address, which is recited daily to reinforce their connection to the world. Here is a glimpse into the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address: **The People:** The Haudenosaunee gather their minds together as one and give greetings and thanks to each other as people, acknowledging their duty to live in balance and harmony. **The Earth Mother:** They express their gratitude to the Earth for providing all that they need for life and supporting their feet as they walk upon her. **The Waters:** The Haudenosaunee give thanks to all the waters of the world for quenching their thirst and providing strength in various forms, such as waterfalls, rain, mists, streams, rivers, and oceans. **The Fish:** They turn their minds to the fish life in the water, acknowledging their role in cleansing and purifying the water and providing food. **The Plants:** The Haudenosaunee give thanks to the vast fields of plant life, which sustain many life forms and work many wonders. **The Food Plants:** They honor and thank all the food plants they harvest from the garden, which have helped the people survive since the beginning of time. **The Medicine Herbs:** The Haudenosaunee express their gratitude to all the medicine herbs of the world, which were instructed to take away sickness and heal. **The Animals:** They gather their minds together to send greetings and thanks to all the animal life in the world, which teaches them many things and provides food. **The Trees:** The Haudenosaunee turn their thoughts to the trees, which have their own instructions and uses, providing shelter, shade, fruit, beauty, and other useful things. **The Birds:** They put their minds together as one and thank all the birds for their beautiful songs and the joy they bring to life. **The Four Winds:** The Haudenosaunee are thankful to the powers of the Four Winds, which refresh and purify the air they breathe and help bring the change of seasons. By giving daily thanks, the Haudenosaunee maintain a strong connection to the world around them and foster a sense of gratitude and appreciation for all living things. This tradition serves as a reminder to us all to acknowledge the blessings in our lives and live in harmony with the world.
