One of the most significant moments in Strasburg's career came in the 2019 World Series, when he led the Nationals to their first championship in franchise history. His performance throughout the series, culminating in a dominant Game 6 victory, earned him the prestigious World Series MVP award. In the aftermath of the victory, Strasburg expressed his gratitude for the support of his teammates, coaches, and fans, saying, 'I couldn't have done it without the incredible people around me.'
