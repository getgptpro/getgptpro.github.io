# Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster of Tech Layoffs

The great grey **beast** known as Tech Layoffs has been on the prowl,
Leaving employees skittish, their nerves in a whirl.

After the *thunder* of a shocking layoff announcement,
There comes a *silence*, an eerie hush,
As we all try to make sense of the future,
Amidst the fear and hope that intertwines.

In one hand I hold the bitter cup of fate,
A severance package, a severance of state.
The other hand holds a *pen*, to write my own story,
To find a new path, to find a new glory.

Technology has both blessed and cursed us,
With opportunities and *impermanence*.
But in the *wasteland* of a layoff's cold heart,
Gratitude will be our *shimmering* guiding star.

### **Gratitude for the Skills We've Gained**
Despite the heartache, we must take a step back,
Appreciate the knowledge that our experience has packed.
Whether coding languages or problem-solving in teams,
Our *skill set* is the *muscle* that fuels our dreams.

### **Gratitude for the New Beginnings**
A forced exit, a harsh reality, a *sudden end*,
Yet it's also a beginning, a *chance* to ascend.
Look for the silver lining, the new dawn's first light,
A fresh start to pursue what sets our souls alight.

### **Gratitude for Resilience We Didn't Know We Had**
Each day after the layoff is a testament to our *resilience*,
A testament to our strength and our *persistence*.
Gradually we forge ahead, turning the page,
Our courage and *perseverance* will be our *salvation*.

### **Gratitude for the Community Around Us**
Yes, we are *scarred* from this shared experience,
Yet the bond we forge is *unique* and intense.
Standing by each other, we *navigate* the storm,
A stronger community answers the *storm's* alarm.

In the hushed aftermath, as the dust settles,
We find strength and courage in our setbacks.
With a heart full of gratitude, we move on,
Embracing every step in this *emotional odyssey*.
