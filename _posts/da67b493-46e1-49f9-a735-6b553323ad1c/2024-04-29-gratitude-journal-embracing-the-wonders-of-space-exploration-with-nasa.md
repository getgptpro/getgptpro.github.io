As we look up at the night sky, we are often filled with a sense of awe and wonder. The vastness of the universe and the mysteries it holds have captivated human imagination for centuries. NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has been at the forefront of space exploration, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. In this article, we will explore the recent activities of NASA and how they can inspire gratitude in our lives.

**1. NASA's Solar Eclipse Research**

On August 21, 2017, millions of people across the United States witnessed a total solar eclipse. This celestial event not only provided a breathtaking view but also offered a unique opportunity for scientific research. NASA launched three sounding rockets during the eclipse to study the Sun's corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. These rockets carried instruments to collect data on the Sun's magnetic fields, which can help us understand the behavior of solar storms and their impact on Earth.

**2. Gratitude for the Gift of Knowledge**

As we reflect on the incredible achievements of NASA, we can't help but feel grateful for the gift of knowledge. The pursuit of understanding the universe is a testament to human curiosity and our desire to learn. Gratitude journaling can help us appreciate the efforts of scientists and researchers who dedicate their lives to expanding our understanding of the cosmos.

**3. The Parker Solar Probe: A Closer Look at the Sun**

NASA's Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, has completed its 19th close approach to the Sun. This groundbreaking mission aims to study the Sun's outer atmosphere and its effects on space weather. As we write in our gratitude journals, we can express our gratitude for the technological advancements that make such ambitious missions possible.

**4. Drone Research at Fort Drum**

NASA conducted drone research at Fort Drum during the solar eclipse, using the unique conditions to study the Earth's atmosphere and its response to the eclipse. This research can help improve our understanding of the Earth's climate and weather patterns. Gratitude journaling can be a way to acknowledge the importance of such research and the people behind it.

**5. Gratitude for the Beauty of the Universe**

As we explore the wonders of space through the lens of NASA's research and missions, we are reminded of the beauty and majesty of the universe. Gratitude journaling can help us appreciate the awe-inspiring sights, such as the solar eclipse, and the countless other celestial events that fill us with wonder.

**Conclusion:**

In our gratitude journal, we can find a space to express our appreciation for the incredible work done by NASA and the countless scientists and researchers who contribute to our understanding of the universe. As we write down our grateful thoughts, we can also reflect on the beauty and mystery of the cosmos, and the privilege of being part of this vast, interconnected universe.
