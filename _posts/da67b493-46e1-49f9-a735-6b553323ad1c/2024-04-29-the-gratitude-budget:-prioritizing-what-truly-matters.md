# The Gratitude Budget: Prioritizing What Truly Matters

Unlike autumn leaves crunch underfoot, unlike spring's first scent,
A budget for gratitude, a journey not violent,
A way of life, a way of love, a path where peace is lent,
A gratitude budget, a tool for us, a place to find our tent.

In these days of endless noise, where stress and worries never cease,
We cling to wealth as our defense, our safety net, our peace,
But with material ties, we're bound by miseries,
And the voices in our heads, which never seem to noice decrease.

Yet what if we created a budget, not for gold or greed,
But for a gratitude that's rich and runs both broad and deep.
A travel back to where we were, to where our roots did seed,
To lessons learned, to joys endured, to lives not left in need.

When we were kids, our laughter loud, our games never done,
The little things that made us proud, the simple fun,
The rain puddle jump, the park in golden sun,
Our world, a vast and wondrous echo, beyond the city's hum.

Now, a chance we take to walk on paths of gratitude's hue,
To cherish what tomorrow's day is yet to draw anew.
To open our hearts, to share the love we grew,
To appreciate, to give, to live our lives anew.

With a gratitude budget, we'll shun division and sorrow,
We'll teach the world a life beyond the wealth tomorrow.
In its place, love, peace, joy, the future's quite in store,
For a gratitude budget, is what brings us closer than before.
