# Grateful for the Skies: A Celestial Gratitude Journal  

> *A diary of celestial wonders and natural awe*  

In the realm of vastness  
Where the skies merge with the earth,  
We find ourselves in awe  
Of nature's artistic worth.  

## The Stargazer's Joy  
Once upon an evening walk,  
a shooting star did pass,  
A fleeting moment of pure bliss,  
A cosmic traveler in haste.  

## The Cloud Whisperer's Delight  
Drifting shapes in white and grey,  
Cotton candy in the sky,  
Ever-changing yet comforting,  
The voice of the clouds speak.  

## The Nature Watcher's Reverence  
Beneath the ancient oak's embrace,  
I rest my head, find my place,  
Grateful for air, for space,  
For nature's wisdom that graces.  

## The Sun's Glorious Rise  
Every morning, a new dawn,  
The sun ascends, bathes us in warmth,  
An invigorating start,  
To nature's daily art.  

## A Gratitude Chant  
Let us, in our hearts, entwine  
Gratitude for the skies divine,  
Where nature's tales are sewn,  
In the fabric of a humble home.  

## Harmony with the Environment  
In the symphony of life, we blend,  
With the skimming swallow,  
The rustling leaves, the river's bend,  
In the grand celestial, where we wend.

_Come, let us be in harmonic tune, with the nature we live in,_  
_With the celestial drum, beat of the universe,_  
_In every sunbeam's kiss, in every starry missive._

*May we forever be grateful for the sky's embrace,*  
*for the changing seasons' grace,*  
*for the environment's vast space,*  
*where we find our humble place.*
