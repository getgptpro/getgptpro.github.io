# Sustainable Tuna: A Guide to Ethical Seafood Choices  

> On World Tuna Day, we celebrate the king of the sea,   
> Tuna a source of food and economy,  
> We must remember to keep it sustainable,  
> To preserve it for generations to be free.  

## The Common Plight of Tuna  

In the vast ocean's depths, the story is the same,   
A race against time, a game of high stakes.  
Overfishing has become a widespread bane,   
That threatens the balance, a cause for concern and pain.  

But fear not, for there's still hope and cheer,   
For sustainable fishing is drawing near.  

## Ethical Choices: The Key to Survival  

Once upon an ocean, there lived a school of tuna,  
Their numbers once many, their future in the moon.  
A small fishing village relied on their grace,  
Their livelihood, their child's happiness, in this place.  

But after years of unsustainable capture, they would cry,  
As the tuna numbers dwindled, threatening to fly.  

Enter the village elder, with wisdom so sheer,  
Promising a future where everyone could revere.  

He introduced 'Sustainable Tuna' and a heart so pure,  
Ensuring their survival, nothing to obscure.  

## A New Hope: Sustainable Tuna Fishing  

And so they learned to respect the ocean’s demands,  
By only fishing when tuna populations expanded.  
Enough to protect juveniles, yet plenty to serve the meals,  
Creating a sustainable cycle that ensures survival of the species.  

Thus, World Tuna Day isn’t just a day, it’s a way,  
A commit to ethical seafood choices every day.  

## The Call to Action  

So on this day, let's embark on a journey so grand,  
And make every day, a 'World Tuna Day' in our own land.  
It's not just about eating, but also about understanding,  
To keep the oceans thriving and the planet blending.
