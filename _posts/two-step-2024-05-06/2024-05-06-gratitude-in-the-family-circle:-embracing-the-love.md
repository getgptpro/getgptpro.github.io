# Gratitude in the Family Circle: Embracing the Love  

In the hearth's warm glow, where whispers of love grow,  
We gather our hearts, together as one, as a family bound.  

### To Mother, Our Rock and Strength  

The morning sun paints your smile, a beacon of unwavering light,  
As you prepare our world, your love in each gesture tight.  
The nourishment from your table, the wisdom from your words,  
Grateful we are, for a mother who never has sworn.  

### To Father, Our Guide and Shield  

Your stories, a map of knowledge vast and wide,  
Guiding through the shadows, your love at our side.  
The words of wisdom you weave, with threads of understanding,  
A fortress of support, that’s our loving father commanding.  

### To Siblings, Our Bonds of Kin  

In laughter and tears, the bond we share so tight,  
Embracing your quirks, cherishing every quirky delight,  
Through fall and spring, your guidance, a compelling rite,  
Grateful we are, for cherished and loved siblings who stand right.  

### To Spouses, Our Love's Truest Core  

United in love, our souls are forever entwined,  
Through happiness and heartache, with you we shall find.  
With gratitude for your love and understanding, we’re blessed,  
Embracing our family, a love that’s never oppressed.  

### Our Family Circle's Sweet Embrace  

With each milestone achieved, and each hurdle surpassed,  
In the family circle, love finds its love-struck heart.  
From a newborn’s first smile, to elderly wisdom’s final grace,  
Gratitude abounds in the harmonious family space.  

_As we hold hands around our family tree,   
Each member unique, like a precious jewel,   
Shared moments of love we forever will keep,   
Gratitude in our hearts for our family’s sweet sleep._
