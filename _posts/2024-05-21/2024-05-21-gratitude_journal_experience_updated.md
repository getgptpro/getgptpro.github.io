# How I Overcame Depression Through 170,000 Words of Gratitude Journaling

## Introduction
Writing a diary has evolved from a mere attempt to persist in it to a habit that I have formed over the past five years. Initially, my diary was a simple record of daily life, but it eventually became a powerful tool that helped me manage and overcome my severe depression. Through consistent journaling, I discovered the profound benefits of maintaining a gratitude journal, which not only improved my mental health but also transformed my life.

## Early Stages: The Beginnings of My Diary
When I first started keeping a diary, I used the paper method, jotting down the daily life accounts. Due to severe depressive emotions, my daily activities were also very limited, so the amount of writing was quite small, and it took less than ten minutes to write with a pen. I would arrange it when the sky began to darken, like a ritual, which was a summary of the whole day's life. This routine provided a small sense of stability during a turbulent time.

## The Middle Period: Awareness and Emotional Exploration
As time went on, I started to become more aware of my emotions and tried to describe my feelings towards things. The amount of writing began to increase, and I switched to an electronic format, using my phone's memo during the day and the computer at night. The content was mostly complaints, self-hatred, and despair about the futureâ€”negative words that reflected my state of mind. I no longer confined my writing to the evenings; instead, I wrote whenever negative emotions appeared.

During this phase, even though I felt depressed, I forced myself to maintain basic self-care routines: eating, drinking, going to school, and working. The diary became a place to vent my feelings and prevent my thoughts from spiraling out of control. This was the most painful stage because the process was very long, and it was easy to give up. However, it was also crucial for my eventual recovery.

## Later Stages: Improvement and Integration
In the last one or two years, I gradually improved. I was able to socialize normally, make new friends, and my life became more fulfilling. The content of the diary began to focus on real people and events in the real world, and I continued to check my emotions and describe my feelings. The entries generally exceeded a thousand words at a time.

In the last half year, I have been trying a combination of paper and electronic methods. The electronic records are more fragmented, often capturing fleeting thoughts or more detailed descriptions. Paper records are for noting the happiest thing of the day. If there isn't one, I use beautiful language to praise myself from various angles. It's best to present a positive attitude on paper, and after writing, I basically believe it.

## The Benefits of Keeping a Gratitude Journal
Through maintaining a gratitude journal, I experienced several significant benefits:

### Acceptance of Self
Many times when interacting with the outside world, I felt pressured to exhibit positive qualities and suppress negative emotions. Over time, this made it difficult for me to accept my negative traits. The diary gave me a chance to delve into my heart and realize that I didn't have to be perfect. I learned to accept myself, flaws and all.

### Reduced Self-Criticism
Originally, I had many expectations for myself and liked to compete with others. If I couldn't meet these expectations, I would feel self-loathing or overeat. Through journaling, I became more peaceful and stopped setting unattainable goals for myself. I no longer blamed and tortured myself for making mistakes or being foolish, and I stopped overly concerning myself with other people's lives.

### Increased Happiness and Relaxation
I began to live a much more relaxed and happy life. I realized that while troubles are unchangeable, improving my life had to start with myself. By dedicating enough time to self-reflection and gratitude, I experienced a turning point.

## Conclusion
Keeping a gratitude journal has been a transformative experience for me. It helped me manage and eventually overcome my depression by fostering self-acceptance, reducing self-criticism, and increasing my overall happiness. If you are struggling with similar challenges, I encourage you to try maintaining a gratitude journal. It may take time, but with patience and dedication, it can lead to profound improvements in your mental health and well-being.
