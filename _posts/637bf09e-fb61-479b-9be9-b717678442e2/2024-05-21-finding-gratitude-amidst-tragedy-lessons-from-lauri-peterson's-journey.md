### **The Role of Gratitude in Healing**

In times of grief and loss, it can be challenging to find anything to be grateful for. However, practicing gratitude can be a powerful tool in the healing process. It allows us to shift our focus from what we have lost to what we still have and appreciate. For Lauri, this might mean finding solace in the memories of her son and the love and support of her family and friends.

### **Practicing Gratitude: A Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Acknowledge the Pain**: Before we can find gratitude, it's essential to acknowledge and validate our feelings of loss and grief. It's okay to feel pain and sadness.

2. **Identify the Positives**: Start by identifying small things in your life that you are grateful for. It could be a supportive friend, a beautiful sunset, or a warm cup of coffee.

3. **Write It Down**: Keeping a gratitude journal, like the one inspired by Lauri's story, can help you focus on the positive aspects of your life. Write down three things each day that you are grateful for.

4. **Share Your Gratitude**: Sharing your feelings of gratitude with others can be healing and can also inspire them to find gratitude in their lives.

5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Being present and mindful can help you appreciate the blessings in your life, even when they are hidden in plain sight.

### **The Power of Community Support**

The support Lauri has received from the RHOC community and beyond is a reminder of the power of community in times of crisis. Connecting with others who have experienced similar losses can provide comfort and a sense of belonging.

### **Conclusion**

While it may seem impossible to find gratitude amidst tragedy, the journey of Lauri Peterson and the loss of her son Joshua Waring teaches us that it is possible. By acknowledging our pain, identifying the positives, writing them down, sharing our gratitude, and practicing mindfulness, we can find a silver lining even in the darkest of times. The support of a community can also play a crucial role in this journey, reminding us that we are not alone in our struggles.
