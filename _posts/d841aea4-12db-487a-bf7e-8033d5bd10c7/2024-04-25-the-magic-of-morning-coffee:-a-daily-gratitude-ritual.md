# The Magic of Morning Coffee: A Daily Gratitude Ritual

> *In every drop of Melancholy lies the presence of God.* - Rumi

Ah, the morning coffee. The quiet stir, the gentle hum,
The sun's subtle warm kiss against the pane.
It's more than just a drink, it's a simple pleasure,
A sacred ritual, a moment to regain.

### The Gratitude of Brew

I sit by my window, the first light of dawn,
Coffee's aroma, a gift from somewhere unknown.
The world slows down, I gaze at the horizon,
A beautiful blend of gratitude and emotion.

### The Magic Revealed

As the coffee in my cup begins to swirl,
Each sip is mine, a story unfurl.
I muse on the wonders of another day,
A heart full of thanks for the smallest display.

### The Quiet Time

The pillowy calm, a moment to dwell,
In the symphony of morning's delicate spell.
Every muted sound, an ode to the universe,
A moment to be, a moment to immerse.

### The Morsel of Thought

In the silent hum of the morning light,
Endless stories unfold with pure sight.
A sip, a thought, a day to seize,
A quiet tribute, the universe sees.

It's not just coffee, it's the morning's heartfelt letter,
An everyday ritual for better or for better.
A cup to share, a cup to enjoy,
A cup that brings joy in the morning's voice.

A daily cup, a ritual true,
A moment to renew, with coffee's hue,
For in its warmth, a world I've found,
A daily gratitude, a daily round.
