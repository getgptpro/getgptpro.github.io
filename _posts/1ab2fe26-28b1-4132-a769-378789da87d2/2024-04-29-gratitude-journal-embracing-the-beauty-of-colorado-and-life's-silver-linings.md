**1. The Splendor of Colorado's Natural Wonders**

Colorado is home to some of the most breathtaking landscapes in the United States. From the majestic Rocky Mountains to the serene beauty of the Great Sand Dunes National Park, there's no shortage of natural wonders to be grateful for. Embracing the beauty of these landscapes can help us find a sense of awe and appreciation for the world around us. In our Gratitude Journal, we can record the moments spent exploring these wonders and the feelings of gratitude they inspire.

**2. Celebrating Sports Achievements**

The recent victory of the No. 14 Women's Tennis team from UCLA against Colorado is a testament to the dedication, hard work, and sportsmanship displayed by these athletes. In our Gratitude Journal, we can celebrate these achievements and the positive impact they have on our communities. By focusing on the success stories and the spirit of competition, we can cultivate a sense of gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that sports provide.

**3. The Importance of Higher Education**

Education is a powerful tool that can transform lives and shape the future. In Colorado, there's a growing emphasis on increasing flexibility in higher education, as highlighted in a recent guest column. This focus on accessibility and innovation in education is something to be grateful for, as it opens doors for individuals to pursue their dreams and contribute to the betterment of society. In our Gratitude Journal, we can acknowledge the role that education plays in our lives and the lives of others, and express our appreciation for the opportunities it provides.

**4. Finding Gratitude in the Eye of Life's Storms**

Life is full of challenges and unexpected obstacles, but it's in these moments that we can find our true strength and resilience. Gratitude Journal can be a powerful tool in helping us focus on the blessings that surround us, even when they're hidden in plain sight. By taking a few minutes each day to write down three grateful thoughts, we can train our minds to look for the silver linings in every situation, no matter how difficult.

**5. Counting Blessings, Not Troubles**

In the midst of life's storms, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the troubles that we face. However, by shifting our focus to the blessings in our lives, we can find a sense of peace and happiness that transcends our circumstances. Gratitude Journal encourages us to count our blessings and recognize the positive aspects of our lives, even when they may seem scarce.
