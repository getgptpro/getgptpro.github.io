# Counting My Coins: A Journey to Financial Gratitude

> Money, the fuel of our daily routines,
> A flow that sustains our lives like streams.

I've always been grateful for the stability,
> Financially blessed, it's no fantasy.

Once upon a time, in capricious economies,
> My savings withered, like flowers in gusty cities.
But today, I can finally say,
> I have met my daily bread in many ways.

With each coin I count, my gratitude grows,
> A symbol of choices and freedom it bestows.
From the roof over my head, to the food I eat,
> I celebrate my journey, however unique.

Investments, wise they were indeed,
> A garden of wealth, well-tilled and well-seed.
Like a tree, it has grown, so tall and grand,
> Providing shelter to my family and my clan.

In the marketplace of the world, I found my space,
> A balance, a harmony, a beautiful grace.
With each transaction, I bless my gains,
> Each penny a pearl, on life's golden chains.

Let us not forget those who aren't as lucky,
> Whose pockets weigh with none but worry.
So let us share and show, empathy and grace,
> In every coin lies a ray of a better place.
