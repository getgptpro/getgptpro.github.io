# Appreciating the Unexpected: A Gratitude Journal of San Diego's Outdoor Performances

Hello blog readers! üåû

I've always been someone who loves exploring the not-so-obvious elements of a city. So when San Diego's Without Walls (WOW) Festival crossed my path, I couldn't contain my curiosity. Imagine my delight at discovering this gem of an event which brings together local artists and creatives in unconventional outdoor venues.

## The Art of Surrendering Control

My first encounter with the festival was last summer at the local park. I was just taking my morning jog when I heard music that made me stop mid-stride. There I found a group of artists, each one with a different instrument, playing a melody that was incredibly harmonious. It was spontaneous. It was beautiful. And it was unexpected. It was my first lesson in surrendering control and embracing the unexpected.

## Fostering Creativity and Joy

The festival hosts a series of intimate shows in venues like community gardens, rooftops, even abandoned warehouses. It's not just a platform for performers to showcase their talents, but it‚Äôs a way to create experiences that evoke emotions and create connections between the people of San Diego.

This year, I had the great honor of attending a performance in a community garden where a group of young actors re-enacted a play about the history of San Diego. It taught me so much about my city and it was magical to see these history come alive in such a unique setting. It made me appreciate the importance of local stories and cultures.

## Building Communities

One significant and unexpected outcome of these performances is the building of communities. San Diegans from diverse backgrounds come together, connecting over shared laughter, empathy, and even tears. This coming together transcends race, age, or social status. It unites people not just as viewers but as participants in the creative process.

## A Final Thought

The San Diego WOW Festival has been a beacon of joy and inspiration in my life. The experiences it offers are unique and transform our city into a canvas for creativity. It's an unexpected delight that I'm profoundly grateful for.

I'm looking forward to the next festival with excitement and anticipation for the stories yet to be told and the communities yet to be created.

### Until next time, there‚Äôs always something to be grateful for. ‚ù§Ô∏è
