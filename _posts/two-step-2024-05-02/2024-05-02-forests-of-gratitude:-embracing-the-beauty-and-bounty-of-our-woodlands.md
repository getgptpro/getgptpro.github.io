# Forests of Gratitude: Embracing the Beauty and Bounty of Our Woodlands

Forests, tall and proud, 
Their leaves a verdant shroud; 
Castles of the sylvan kind, 
Guardians of the wild.

On this blessed Arbor Day, 
We pay homage, far and wide, 
For these trees, the lungs and heart, 
Of our Earth, where we reside.

In our tale, let's journey back, 
To a time when all was track, 
Our family, young and old, 
Planting saplings, brave and bold.

*Mother Nature's gift, we honour,*
*Her timber, beauty, and her power.*

The maple, her sweet syrup's flow, 
Oak's strength, in every blow;
Birch, of paper made with grace, 
Pine, for homes, a warm embrace.

Trees, they give us life's pure elixir, 
Sheltering us from the fire; 
For every tree that stands tall and free, 
We owe a debt of gratitude.

In the hush of the forest's shade, 
We find calm, our hearts are made, 
A sanctuary of peace and health, 
For the soul and for the self.

Thus, on this day that we uphold, 
Let's not forget to retell 
The story of these sylvan friends, 
Their worth, it never ends.

So let us bow and express, 
Our deepest love and bless, 
The trees and forests all, 
Giving us so much, standing tall.
