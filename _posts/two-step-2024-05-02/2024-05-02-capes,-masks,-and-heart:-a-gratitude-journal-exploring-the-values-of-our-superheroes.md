# Capes, Masks, and Heart: A Gratitude Journal Exploring the Values of Our Superheroes

April 28th is National Superhero Day, a day to celebrate not only the fictional heroes who entertain us with their acts of heroism but also the real-life role models who embody values such as courage, justice, and positive change. Today, we will take the time to reflect on these values and the superheroes who inspire us to be better.

## Courage: The Heart of a Hero

Everyone knows a superhero is not afraid to face danger. But what does it mean to be courageous? For me, it's going against my fears. For example, my friend Alex was always afraid of public speaking, but during our school's career fair, they decided to face their fear. Alex bravely stood in front of hundreds of people and delivered an inspiring speech on the importance of pursuing your passion. They became the humble superhero of the day, earning my admiration and gratitude.

## Justice: The Quest for Fairness

Superheroes are known for their quest for justice and fairness. In our everyday lives, we can be the superheroes too. Think about our kind neighbor, the one who makes sure that everyone in our community is treated fairly. They stand up for what's right, whether it's speaking against bullying or ensuring no one gets excluded. They are our local superheroes, an inspiration to us all.

## Positive Change: Heroes for a Better Tomorrow

Superheroes are often the embodiment of positive change. They bring hope where there is despair. Let's take the example of a community garden. It started with a single person who saw a need for a place where people could come together and benefit from nature. This person, let's call them Sam, took action and turned a desolate area into a flourishing garden. Sam is our superhero who brought positive change to our community.

In conclusion, superheroes are not just fictional characters on the pages of a comic book or on the movie screen. They are real people who inspire us through their values of courage, justice, and positive change. On this National Superhero Day, let's take a moment to reflect on the superheroes around us and express our gratitude for their acts of heroism.
