# Rooted in Gratitude: The Unseen Heroes of Our Environment

With a heart that sways like a leaf in the breeze, 
I pen these words on a day that brings us trees.
 Arbor Day arrives, the last Friday in April, 
 A celebration of the guardians that we revere.

Imagine a world without these towering might, 
The silent sentinels standing tall in flight.
 With roots that anchor deep beneath the ground, 
 They tie our ecosystems to a hopeful bound.

Heroes they are, but unseen to most of our eyes, 
 Their story untold, they stand and quietly rise.
 Trees of every kind, a sight to behold, 
 From the mighty Oak that's bold and grows old,
 To the delicate Maple with leaves of gold.

Arbor Day implores, to plant, tend, and care, 
 For these verdant beings that grace our fair share.
 Through the rustling of leaves on a soft summer's breeze, 
 To the shelter they provide, the environment they cleanse.

In the quiet moments, when the world's too loud, 
 They provide us with shade, and offer us a proud.
 They give without taking, their wisdom is bound, 
 In every acorn, a mighty tree is found.

So here's to the trees, on this day of the year, 
 To Arbor Day, and the unseen heroes that endear.
 We owe them our gratitude, we owe them our thanks, 
 For without them, our world would be far less enchants.
