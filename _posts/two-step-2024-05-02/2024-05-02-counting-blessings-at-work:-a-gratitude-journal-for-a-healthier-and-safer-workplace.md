# Counting Blessings at Work: A Gratitude Journal for a Healthier and Safer Workplace

Hey there, fellow workers! 👋

On the 28th of April, we celebrate **World Day for Safety and Health at Work**. This is a perfect day to count our blessings at work, and what better way to do that than by writing a gratitude journal! 📝

## 🧠 Mindful Monday: Safety First

At the office, we have this one colleague, let's call her Sally, who always wears her safety goggles, even when she's just typing on her computer (her excuse: 'you never know when a screen might burst!'). 🤓 We used to laugh, but her constant vigilance has actually made us all more aware of our surroundings. Today, I'm grateful for Sally's over-the-top caution - it's made our workplace a safer place for everyone!

## 🏋️‍♂️ Tuesday's Teamwork: A Healthy Dose of Fun

Our workplace has this tradition of 'Bring Your Own Exercise' every Tuesday. We've had everything from desk yoga to makeshift tug of war (which we do with the office printer cord, because who needs a real rope, right?). It's a bit silly, but it's also a great way to keep our bodies and minds in shape. Today, I'm grateful for the breath of fresh air that is our Tuesday routine.

## 🌳 Wednesday's Windowsill Garden: A Bite of Nature Inside

Ever had a cactus that's collected more dust than it is thorns? Meet Bob's windowsill garden. We all thought it was a disaster waiting to happen, but Bob has managed to keep it alive. Today, I'm grateful for Bob's stubborn determination, it's a symbol of hope in the middle of our office jungle.

## 🍎 Thursday's Treats: Sharing is Caring

Every Thursday, someone brings in a treat to share (it's usually Tim with his 'experimental' pastries). Today, I'm grateful for these accidental baking adventures. It's a small gesture, but it's brought our team closer together.

## 📚 Friday's Finances: Learning to Budget

Friday is our financial fitness day. While it may not sound exciting, it's a great reminder to both save and invest wisely. Today, I'm grateful for these sessions, they've helped us become financially smarter and healthier.

So here's to a healthier and safer workplace, all while having a few laughs along the way! Remember to always be mindful and keep a lookout for your fellow workers. It's all about team work and being there for each other, because at the end of the day, we're more than just colleagues, we are a family.

*Happy World Day for Safety and Health at Work, everyone!* 🌍💪
