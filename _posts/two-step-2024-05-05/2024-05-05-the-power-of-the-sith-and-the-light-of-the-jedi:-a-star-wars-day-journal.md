# The Power of the Sith and the Light of the Jedi: A Star Wars Day Journal  

**May 4, 2021** - Today, I woke up with the *Force* flowing through my veins as I celebrated the pun 'May the Fourth be with you.' It's incredible how a simple phrase can bring so much joy and unity to the *Star Wars* fan family.  

## A Morning with Yoda  
My morning started with a hearty breakfast of *Jedi* Toast – a simple meal with a galaxy far, far away in my eyes. I swear I heard Yoda's voice whispering, *'When 9 it is, breakfast time will be.'*  

## The Sith Down Memory Lane  
As I reminisced about my favorite *Star Wars* moments, I couldn't help but smile at the thought of Darth Vader in the princess carriage scene. I must admit, it was oddly satisfying imagining the Sith Lord as a horse. *'No!'* I laughed. *'That's not a horse!'*  

## An Afternoon of Lightsabers and Lights  
After a hearty meal, I decided to indulge in a bit of lightsaber training. I swung my makeshift lightsaber, imagining I was a Jedi Knight protecting the galaxy. A bit dramatic, I know, but the *Force* was strong with this exercise.  

## Galactic Gatherings and Galactic Jars  
In the evening, I attended a *Star Wars*-themed potluck party. Everyone brought dishes inspired by the galaxy – from *'Bantha Slopp'* to *'Tatooine Teriyaki.'* I made a *Galactic Jar* filled with colorful layers of goodness, and it was a hit!  

## Bedtime Stories with Qui-Gon Jinn  
Finally, to end the day, I decided to read a *Star Wars* bedtime story to my daughter. We snuggled up, and she listened in wonder as I narrated the tale of Qui-Gon Jinn and his adventures across the cosmos. My heart swelled with gratitude for these stories that connect generations of fans.  

And so, I bid goodnight to my little padawan with the words, *'May the Fourth be with you, always.'*  

Happy Star Wars Day, fellow fans!
