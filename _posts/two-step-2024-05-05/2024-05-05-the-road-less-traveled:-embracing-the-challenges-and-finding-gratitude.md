Midway through my journey, the global pandemic brought the world to a halt. I was stranded in a foreign land, unsure of when I'd be able to return home. The days were filled with anxiety and uncertainty. Yet, in the midst of this crisis, I discovered the power of community and kindness. Strangers became friends, and together, we found ways to adapt and survive. This period taught me the true meaning of gratitude and the strength of the human spirit.
