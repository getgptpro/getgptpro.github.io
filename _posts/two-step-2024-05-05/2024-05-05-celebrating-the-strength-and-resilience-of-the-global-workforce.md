# Celebrating the Strength and Resilience of the Global Workforce  

> *May 1, Acknowledge both the joy of spring and the achievements of workers worldwide on this day that doubles as International Workers' Day.*  

## A Poem to the Worker's Soul  

_They rise with the sun, painted warriors,_  
_Their hands, a brush, hearts, a burning fire,_  
_Bringing order to the chaotic world,_  
_Twisting shadows into light, hope intertwined._  

Through harsh summers and relentless cold,_  
_They stand, unmoved, fortified and bold,_  
_Initiates of a silent creed,_  
_Grinding down odds till they're made to bleed._  

_But on this day, we pause to gaze,_  
_May Day, a testament to their days,_  
_The gardens they've sown, the roads they've paved,_  
_A global chorus of unity we've saved._  

Let us cherish the builders, the healers, the thinkers,_  
And the silent, the strong, the unblinking blinkers,_  
For on this day, we celebrate the might,_  
Of the global workforce, nestled in the night._  

May 1st, we remember, we honor, we care,_  
Every worker a chapter, in a book thatâ€™s rare,_  
A testament to strength, to the sum of their worth,_  
A gentle nudge to keep the weary from the dearth._
